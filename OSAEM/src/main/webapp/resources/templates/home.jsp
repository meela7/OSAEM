				<h2>NAEMP - National Aquatic Ecological Monitoring Program</h2>
				<br>
				<p>NAEMP has been assessing the ecological health status of
					surface waters focusing on streams and rivers in Korea since 2007.
					The program involves ecological monitoring of multiple aquatic
					biota such as benthic diatoms, macroinvertebrates, fishes, and
					plants as well as water quality and habitat parameters.</p>

				<p>NAEMP aims to assess the ecological health status of lotic
					environments in Korea by means of biological health indices
					focusing on benthic diatoms, macroinvertebrates, fishes and aquatic
					plants . Half-yearly, NAEMP has been conducting ecological
					monitoring on a national scale at 960 sites in major rivers and
					their tributaries since 2007. Protocols and methods are
					standardized for monitoring and the same set of those standardized
					protocols and methods are used for collecting data at all the
					sites.</p>

				<h2>OSAEM - Open, Sharable and Extensible Data Management
					System for Aquatic Ecological Monitoring</h2>
				<br>
				<p>OSAEM is a RESTful API-based data management system which is
					designed to facilitate and promote the sharing of NAEMP datasets.
					It focuses on enabling a variety of software systems to access the
					NAEMP datasets as easily and flexibly as possible.</p>
